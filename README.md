# Python-Portfolio
All my python progress from basic to supa cool sh1t level
Date initiated : 20 Jul 2024
PS : this is my very first language to begin with, I start with no mentor nor any bootcamps. I am self learning to the top. Of course any problem I encounter I'd ask GPT, Google, idk bout stack overflow but yeah I'll give it a try (Slow feedback experienced from Arduino forum (idk alot about C++ too btw))
